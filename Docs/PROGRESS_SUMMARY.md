# Project Progress Summary

## Current Status (as of July 1, 2025)

### âœ… Project Initialization & Environment Setup
- **Monorepo structure** established with pnpm workspaces:
  - `packages/frontend` (React + Vite + TypeScript + Three.js)
  - `packages/backend` (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
  - `packages/shared` (Common types/utilities)
- **All configuration files** (tsconfig, package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, .gitignore) are in place and correct.
- **PowerShell execution policy** fixed to allow pnpm to run on Windows.
- **pnpm installed globally** and all dependencies installed successfully.
- **Native dependency issues** (canvas/mind-ar) resolved by using MindAR via CDN instead of npm.
- **TypeScript project references** and path aliases fixed for cross-package imports.
- **Frontend and backend both build successfully** with `pnpm --filter frontend build` and `pnpm --filter backend build`.
- **Basic React components scaffolded**: LoadingScreen, InstructionalOverlay, ARScene.
- **Vite config** updated for modern build and mobile optimization.

### ðŸ§ª Testing & TDD
- Jest and React Testing Library are configured for TDD in all packages.
- No feature code has been written yet; all code so far is for scaffolding and environment setup.

### ðŸ“¦ What Works Now
- You can start both frontend and backend dev servers with `pnpm dev:all`.
- The frontend will show a loading screen, request camera access, and display a basic AR scene placeholder.
- The backend runs and exposes a health check endpoint.

## Next Steps

1. **AR Feature Implementation**
   - Integrate MindAR.js (via CDN) with Three.js for real image tracking and 3D overlay.
   - Implement 3D model loading and animation pipeline.
   - Add tap-to-interact logic with Three.js raycasting.

2. **Backend API**
   - Implement endpoints for analytics and Feishu integration.
   - Add data schema and event logging.

3. **UI/UX**
   - Add recenter and info overlays.
   - Improve mobile responsiveness and error handling.

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for all new features (TDD).

5. **Documentation**
   - Keep this summary updated as progress continues.

---

## How to Continue
- Run `pnpm dev:all` to start development.
- Follow the TDD workflow: write tests first, then implement features.
- Refer to `Docs/Spec.md` for detailed requirements and architecture.
