# ARBrochure Project Progress Summary

## Latest Updates (February 2025)

### üß† AR Tracking Algorithm Robustness - IN PROGRESS
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Conducted deep analysis of MindAR's image tracking pipeline, confirming use of scale-invariant feature detection (FREAK descriptors) and local extrema for robust matching.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Investigated and tuned MindAR's core tracking parameters (`filterMinCF`, `filterBeta`, `warmupTolerance`) to improve stability and responsiveness, especially at extreme view angles and under transformation.
- **Stabilization Layer**: Enhanced the pose smoothing and stability logic to adaptively respond to feature tracking quality, leveraging MindAR's internal confidence and scale-invariance metrics.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Refined Three.js mocks and test coverage to ensure that tests reveal logic flaws in stabilization and tracking, not just mock issues.
- **Next Steps**: Ongoing validation of tracking robustness across devices and conditions, with a focus on minimizing jitter, maximizing tracking persistence, and ensuring rapid recovery from tracking loss.

## AR Tracking Stability Development Plan

### üéØ Problem Statement
Current AR image tracking is too sensitive to camera and image trembling, causing:
- Jittery 3D model positioning
- Frequent tracking loss during minor camera movements
- Poor user experience with unstable AR content overlay

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
MindAR tracking system uses several stability parameters:
- **filterMinCF**: Minimum confidence threshold for tracking
- **filterBeta**: Controls smoothing filter responsiveness
- **warmupTolerance**: Frames required before showing tracking
- **missTolerance**: Frames tolerance before losing tracking

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution Strategy

#### Phase 1: Parameter Investigation & Testing Framework
- Extract default values from MindAR controller code
- Create controlled testing environment with stability metrics
- Record baseline jitter/stability measurements

#### Phase 2: Stability Parameter Optimization
- Configure tracking parameters for improved stability
- Implement user-configurable stability modes (Responsive, Stable, Ultra-Stable)
- Add adaptive parameters based on movement detection

#### Phase 3: Advanced Smoothing Implementation
- Add pose smoothing layer on top of MindAR tracking
- Implement temporal filtering and consistency checks
- Add movement prediction for smoother transitions

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Comprehensive testing across devices and lighting conditions
- Performance impact assessment
- User experience validation

### üìä Success Metrics

#### Quantitative Targets
- **Jitter Reduction**: < 2px movement tolerance for stable objects
- **Tracking Persistence**: > 90% uptime during minor hand tremor
- **Performance**: Maintain > 30 FPS on target devices
- **Accuracy**: < 5% degradation in tracking precision

#### User Experience Targets
- **Perceived Stability**: Significant reduction in AR content jitter
- **Tracking Recovery**: < 1 second recovery time after tracking loss
- **Responsiveness**: < 100ms latency for intentional movements

### üß™ Testing Strategy

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Baseline Stability Test**: Establish performance for each stability mode
2. **Hand Tremor Simulation**: Test jitter reduction effectiveness
3. **Intentional Movement Test**: Verify responsiveness during deliberate camera movement
4. **Tracking Loss Recovery**: Test stabilizer reset and reacquisition performance
5. **Environmental Stress Test**: Performance under challenging conditions

#### Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Responsive Mode | Stable Mode | Ultra-Stable Mode |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Jitter Reduction | >30% vs. no stabilization | >60% vs. no stabilization | >80% vs. no stabilization |
| Response Latency | <100ms | <200ms | <300ms |
| Tracking Persistence | >70% uptime | >85% uptime | >90% uptime |
| Frame Rate | >25 FPS | >25 FPS | >25 FPS |
